In the Vancouver Art Gallery’s presentation of *Edith Heath and Emily Carr: From the Earth*, the curators incorporated supplemental content into the exhibition as a way to introduce Heath to Canadian audiences. That content is presented again here for those interested in taking a deeper dive into Heath’s life and work. "The Barge" offers an intimate glimpse into the private residence of Brian and Edith Heath, itself a quintessential example of California ingenuity and lifestyle. "Factory" provides insight into the Sausalito buildings that have housed Heath Ceramics and their innerworkings of production. "University of British Columbia" traces Heath’s connection to British Columbia and her lasting influence on West Coast design. "Marketing Heath Ceramics" demonstrates how Heath Ceramics appealed to a post-World War II audience interested in a more relaxed and informal dinnerware. "Ashtrays" highlights one of the most recognizable, and for a time profitable, item offered by Heath Ceramics. "Conover Cabinets" reveals how the exhibition utilized a design from the 1959 factory as a central display feature for Heath’s ceramics. Finally, an illustrated timeline documents key moments from Heath’s life and the history of her now 75-year-old company, Heath Ceramics.
