*Edith Heath and Emily Carr: From the Earth* brings together the work of two artists who had a mutual understanding of the land as the source and meaning of their art. Both found a deep inspiration in the landscape---its colours, light, materials---returning again and again to sites that inspired their creativity and defined their practices.

Featuring over 200 works, *Edith Heath and Emily Carr: From the Earth* opened on July 10, 2021 and was on view until March 13, 2022. 

Organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery and curated by Guest Curators Jennifer M. Volland and Jay Stewart, and Bruce Grenville, Senior Curator
