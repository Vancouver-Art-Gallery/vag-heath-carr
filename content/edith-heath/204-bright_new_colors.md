As the product line expanded in the late 1940s, Heath formulated brighter glazes that reflected a new period for the growing company and the lively party culture of the day. Advertisements for two sizes of ashtrays listed the existing dinnerware colours along with the new Currie, Gunmetal and Green Lustre glazes. Verde, Currie and Rock Red brought an increased saturation of colour to the line, while Gunmetal and Green Lustre introduced an elegant metallic look.

> Heath dinnerware is designed for the contemporary home---for indoor and outdoor living---designed for durability and function, pleasant whether used on the patio or for formal ware. *(c. 1960)*

Between 1949 and 1951, Heath Ceramics introduced three new glaze combinations. Each was glazed with Sand or Apricot, then over-sprayed on the edges with a darker glaze, creating a gradient effect. This unique application process using a handheld spray gun illustrates Heath's creative use of tools meant for mass production. The resulting blend of colours reflects the California landscape, as do the glaze names---Sea and Sand, Mountain Blue and Brownstone.
