She knew the Heaths from the time of her birth to their deaths; at their request, she assisted with their personal affairs in their later years.

With her husband, Peter Macnair, Stewart is a peripatetic curator, consulting on the material culture and ethnology of First Nations of the Northwest Coast. Exhibitions and publications include *To the Totem Forests: Emily Carr and Contemporaries Interpret Coastal Villages* (Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, 1998), *Down from the Shimmering Sky: Masks of the Northwest Coast* (Vancouver Art Gallery, 1998), *Listening to the Ancestors: The Art of Native Life in the Pacific Northwest* (National Museum of the American Indian, 2000–2006) and *Raven Travelling: Two Centuries of Haida Art* (Vancouver Art Gallery, 2006)."
